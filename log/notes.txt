display error flash messages. Wnat custom error messages - to do WILL DO TONIGHT

-time sensitive and how long it took them to complete(like date they did it). also language processing!

-add incomplete model=only right now when they click incomplete(then next iteraton when time is up)

-problem potentitally with how many completed tasks they did if in multiple groups- need to do

-want to show all tasks by most recent/oldest if you click them
-stats: chart of activity for group and around what times chores most active

-inviters: ask to join group (limit to number of times you can ask) or person who creates group invites people (only once they have signed up. Basically you search for a user's name and then invite to group that you created. so need creator_id in group category). Now want to ask to join

-bug with not showing all tasks, only tasks alloted to you?! or creator?! or ones you vote for?, should show all the houses tasks in completed. maybe does.
